Miij is a Java framework with an intuitive and straight forward layout manager (FlexLayout)
and some other utility classes.

The layout manager FlexLayout is very easy to use. Just add the layout to the JPanel (or any other container):

   JPanel pnl = new JPanel();
   pnl.setLayout(new FlexLayout());
